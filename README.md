# CSS-loading-

## Features

- **Single Element:** Each loader is created using only a single `div` element.
- **Pure CSS:** The animations and styles are all handled with CSS, with no external libraries or JavaScript dependencies required.
- **Accessible:** The loaders are designed with accessibility in mind, often including "Loading..." text for screen readers.
- **Minimal:** The project focuses on creating simple yet elegant loading animations.
